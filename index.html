        <p>I'm a Software Engineering major who also has the pleasure of serving as the president for TVDS for this academic year. I wanted to do Dynamic Web Development because while it it is not mandatory for my major, I believe it provides a good foundation for a versatile worker. I also really enjoy good design so learning about implementing it on a webpage has been a fascinating experience so far. The cat in the image is my family cat, his name's Oz.</p>
